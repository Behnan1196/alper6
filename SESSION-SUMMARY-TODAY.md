## ⚠️ **KNOWN CONSIDERATIONS**

### **Potential Challenges**
1. **Stream.io Integration**: Token management and channel creation
2. **Real-time Updates**: Ensuring smooth data synchronization
3. **Performance**: Managing large datasets as system scales
4. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensuring coach interface works on tablets

### **Technical Debt**
- Minor Supabase realtime warnings (non-blocking)
- Some TypeScript strict mode warnings to clean up
- Optimization opportunities for large data sets

### **Security Considerations**
- Coach can only see assigned students
- Proper task assignment permissions
- Data isolation between coach groups

---

## 🎨 **UI/UX DESIGN DIRECTION**

### **Coach Interface Design Principles**
- **Professional & Clean**: Similar to admin panel aesthetic
- **Task-Oriented**: Focus on quick task management
- **Student-Centric**: Easy access to student information
- **Mobile-First**: Coaches may use tablets/phones

### **Color Scheme & Branding**
- Maintain current Material UI theme
- Use role-based color coding (Coach = Blue, Student = Green)
- Consistent iconography across all interfaces

---

## 📊 **SUCCESS METRICS FOR TOMORROW**

### **Minimum Viable Goals**
- [ ] Coach dashboard with basic functionality
- [ ] Student list view for assigned coaches
- [ ] Task creation form (basic version)
- [ ] Navigation between coach pages

### **Stretch Goals**
- [ ] Real-time task notifications
- [ ] Student progress visualization
- [ ] Task templates system
- [ ] Basic reporting features

---

## 🔄 **DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW**

### **Recommended Approach**
1. **Start with Database Schema** - Extend tables for coach functionality
2. **Build Layout Components** - Create coach navigation structure
3. **Implement Core Pages** - Dashboard, students, tasks
4. **Add Real-time Features** - Connect to Supabase realtime
5. **Polish & Test** - Ensure smooth user experience

### **Testing Strategy**
- Use existing admin/coach/student test accounts
- Test coach-student assignment relationships
- Verify task creation and assignment flow
- Ensure proper role-based access control
