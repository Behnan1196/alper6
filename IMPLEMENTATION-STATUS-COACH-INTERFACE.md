## 🔧 **TECHNICAL CHALLENGES RESOLVED**

### **Issue 1: Database Constraint Violation**
- **Problem**: Task creation failing due to task_type constraint
- **Root Cause**: Database only allowed 'study', 'practice', 'exam', 'review' but code was trying to insert 'resource'
- **Solution**: Updated database constraint to include 'resource' type
- **SQL Fix**: `ALTER TABLE tasks ADD CONSTRAINT tasks_task_type_check CHECK (task_type IN ('study', 'practice', 'exam', 'review', 'resource'));`

### **Issue 2: Row Level Security Blocking Student Access**
- **Problem**: Coaches couldn't see their assigned students' names
- **Root Cause**: RLS policies were too restrictive
- **Solution**: Added proper RLS policy allowing coaches to read assigned students
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved and tested

### **Issue 3: Missing Database Columns**
- **Problem**: Code referencing non-existent database columns
- **Solution**: Added all required columns with proper data types and constraints
- **Status**: ✅ All columns added and functional
